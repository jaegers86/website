## Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

Before joining MIT, I worked at the Institute on Behavior and Inequality (briq) as a postdoctoral researcher. My research focuses on labor, public, and behavioral economics. I combine experimental and quasi-experimental methods with large, administrative datasets to shed light on the functioning of labor markets and the origins and consequences of inequality. 

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard University.

Here is my [Full CV](http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/sjaeger/cv).
